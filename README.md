This is an example showing how to implement a chatbot using LanyingIM API and OpenAI API.
This project runs with python 3.7

## Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Python installed, [install it from here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd lanying-connector
   ```

4. Create a new virtual environment

   ```bash
   $ python3 -m venv venv
   $ . venv/bin/activate
   ```

5. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```

7. Add your [OPENAI API key](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file,
